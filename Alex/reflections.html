      <h2>MIT GSW</h2>
      <p>I first got to know about <a href="https://gsw.mit.edu/2019/">MIT GSW</a>in December 2016 when I applied to their business plan competition.
      Much as I did not make it to the finals, I was invited to <a href="https://gsw.mit.edu/2017/">MIT GSW 2017</a></p>
      <p>However, in 2018 shortly before attending that year's event in Bangkok, Thailand I put together a team to pitch to MIT and organize this event in Mauritius where we were eventually chosen as one of the 2 finalists in the world to host in 2019 and subsequesntly settling for 2020</p>
      <p>I learnt to be very proactive, think and do big as well as work in partnerships with other people. I encourage future students to think outside the box and keep their word because trust is very key when executing such projects that involve teams from anywhere in the world</p>

      <h2>IOTAK Solutions</h2>
      <p>Undertanding the problem and getting feedback from potential users has been very key in this journey.</p>
      <p>It all began having worked closely with the entrepreneur ecosystems back home in Kampala, Uganda and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania where I lived for about 3 years.</p>
      <p>I encourage others to have the right skills and possibly team up with others to complement their skills in building products for the market</p>
