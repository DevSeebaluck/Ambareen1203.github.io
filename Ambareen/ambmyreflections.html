    <h2>Application Process</h2>
    <p> My internship at State Informatics Limited was a self-sourced placement. I googled IT companies
        in Mauritius, did my research and applied to SIL via the email address provided on their website.
        After 2 weeks from when I applied, I received a call that I have been selected and to join
        the company on Monday 27 May. I did not have to go through interview process, unlike the other 9
        interns they hired. </p>
</div>

  <div class="info">
    <h2>My role in the company</h2>
    <p> I was an intern in the Business Solutions Department. My job description was to learn thoroughly
      about new Document Management Systems and to create user manuals and documentations on the system.
      The DMS I worked mostly on was Alfresco Community. I had to give a demo to a client, the Mauritius
      Port Authority and to give a demo to my entire department (about 25 employees) </p>
  </div>

  <div class="info">
    <h2>Outcomes of the internship</h2>
    <p> I had a wonderful experience at SIL. My manager and my supervisor were very kind and supportive.
        They did not micromanage me at all. They let me discover things at my own pace. Furthermore, we were
        a group of 10 interns hired, placed in different departments with different supervisors. At the end
        the internship, we were a close knitted family and we also organised outings with other employees.
        This internship gave me invaluable work experience, such as dealing directly with clients and preparing
        a demo for my department. It also gave me wonderful new contacts and friends. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="info">
  <h2>What I would do differently</h2>
  <p> Given the chance to undertake the placement again, I would be more proactive and ask to attend
      client meetings. In the beginning, I was too anxious for official client meetings but once I attended
      and presented, I realised there was nothing to stress about. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="info" id="lastinfo">
    <h2>My Advice to you</h2>
    <p> I would advise any student going to a placement to ask questions. Do not be afraid to ask questions when
        you are not sure of something. An internship is a learning opportunity and you must make the most of it.
        Learn new things outside your comfort zone and always take some time to reflect on what you are doing. </p>
